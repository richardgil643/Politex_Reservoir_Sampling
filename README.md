# Politex_Reservoir_Sampling

This project contains the solution of the Taxi MDP with three different algorithms, 
The Notebook Taxi_Q_learning contains the solution througth TD Lambda. 
The Notebook Taxi_Politex contains the solution with the politex algorithm. 
The Notebook Taxi_Reservoir_sampling contains the solution propoused by Juan Piccioti and Richard Gil with the algorithm Politex + Reservoir Sampling.
